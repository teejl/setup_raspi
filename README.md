# A guide for setting up your Raspberry Pi
by TeeJ

## Introduction

Perhaps you just got a new raspberry pi and do not know how to use it, and need an example of how to setup new users, download applications, and install python packages. I have created this guide to help steer you in the right direction!

## Notes.txt

I have written down a bunch of useful commands and links to guids in the notes.txt file. Feel free to use them accordingly.

## Raspi.init

This is the file that has all the good stuff in it. By good stuff I mean the brains behind the operation. After installing this file you still will not be able to use it. You will first need to enable this file as an executable file. You can do this by using the chmod u+x command. Next you will execute the file and boom everything will start downloading. After everything has been downloaded you will still need to enable a few features with raspi-config. Features like vnc, ssh, and the proper screen resolution.

## Procedure for Initializing Raspberry Pi
Follow the steps carefully and enjoy:
